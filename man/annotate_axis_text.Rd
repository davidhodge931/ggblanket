\arguments{
\item{position}{The position of the axis text. One of "top", "bottom", "left", or "right".}

\item{...}{Require named arguments (and support trailing commas).}

\item{x}{A vector of x-axis breaks for text positioning. Cannot be used together with y.}

\item{y}{A vector of y-axis breaks for text positioning. Cannot be used together with x.}

\item{label}{A vector of text label or a function that takes breaks and returns label. If NULL, uses the \code{scales::comma} on the breaks as label.}

\item{colour}{The colour of the text. Inherits from the current theme axis.text etc.}

\item{size}{The size of the text. Inherits from the current theme axis.text etc.}

\item{family}{The font family of the text. Inherits from the current theme axis.text etc.}

\item{length}{The total distance from the axis line to the text as a grid unit. Defaults to the sum of set theme tick length and relevant margin part.}

\item{margin}{The margin around the background rectangle. Can be a single unit value (applied to all sides) or a margin object with top, right, bottom, left components.}

\item{fill}{The fill colour of the background rectangle. If NULL, defaults to "transparent".}

\item{hjust, vjust}{Horizontal and vertical justification. Auto-calculated based on position if NULL.}

\item{angle}{Text rotation angle. Defaults to 0.}

\item{theme_element}{What to do with the equivalent theme elements. Either "keep" , "transparent", or "blank". Defaults "keep".}
}
\value{
A list of annotation layers and theme elements.

\description{
Create annotated segments of the axis text.

This function is designed to work with a theme that is globally set with \link{set_blanket} or \link[ggplot2:get_theme]{ggplot2::set_theme}.

It should be used with a \code{coord} of \code{ggplot2::coord_cartesian(clip = "off")}.

It only works when panel dimensions are set are set in the theme.
