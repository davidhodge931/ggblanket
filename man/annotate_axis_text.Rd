\arguments{
\item{...}{Require named arguments (and support trailing commas).}

\item{position}{The position of the axis text. One of "top", "bottom", "left", or "right".}

\item{x}{A vector of x-axis breaks for text positioning. Cannot be used together with y.}

\item{y}{A vector of y-axis breaks for text positioning. Cannot be used together with x.}

\item{label}{A vector of text label or a function that takes breaks and returns label. If NULL, uses the \code{scales::comma} on the breaks as label.}

\item{colour}{The colour of the text. Inherits from the current theme axis.text etc.}

\item{size}{The size of the text. Inherits from the current theme axis.text etc.}

\item{family}{The font family of the text. Inherits from the current theme axis.text etc.}

\item{length}{The total distance from the axis line to the text as a grid unit. Defaults to the sum of set theme tick length and relevant margin part.}

\item{margin}{The margin around the background rectangle. Can be a single unit value (applied to all sides) or a margin object with top, right, bottom, left components.}

\item{fill}{The fill colour of the background rectangle. If NULL, defaults to "transparent".}

\item{hjust, vjust}{Horizontal and vertical justification. Auto-calculated based on position if NULL.}

\item{angle}{Text rotation angle. Defaults to 0.}

\item{theme_element}{What to do with the equivalent theme element. Either "transparent", "keep" or "blank". Defaults "transparent".}

\value{
A list of annotation layers and theme elements.

\description{
Create annotated segments of the axis text.

This function is designed to work with a theme that is globally set, so that the annotated text can be made consistent by default.

It only works when panel dimensions are set are set in the theme.

It requires a \code{coord} of \code{ggplot2::coord_cartesian(clip = "off")}.
