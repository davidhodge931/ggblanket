}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Number of colours to generate. Required.}

\item{begin}{The (0–1) value at which to begin the colour scale. Default is 0.}

\item{end}{The (0–1) value at which to end the colour scale. Default is 1.}

\item{option}{A character string indicating the palette option to use.}

Returns a vector of colours from the viridis colour palette (from \code{viridisLite}),
with automatic direction adjustment depending on whether the panel background
is dark or light. This ensures the palette maintains appropriate contrast.
