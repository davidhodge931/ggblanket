\title{Keep elements of a vector in a sequence, and replace the rest with ""}
\usage{
str_keep_seq(x, by = 2, offset = 0, big.mark = ",", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector.}

\item{by}{The increment of elements to keep. Defaults to 2.}

\item{offset}{An offset to start at the intended offset. Defaults to 0. Possible values are -1 to (\code{by} - 2)}

\item{big.mark}{If numeric, the character used between every 3 digits to seperate thousands. Defaults to ",".}

\item{...}{If numeric, other arguments passed to the scales::number function.}
}
\value{
A vector.
}
