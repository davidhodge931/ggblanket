\item{facet}{Unquoted facet aesthetic variable.}

\item{facet2}{Unquoted second facet variable for a facet grid of facet by facet2 variables.}

\item{group}{Unquoted group aesthetic variable.}

\item{text}{Unquoted text aesthetic variable, which can be used in combination with plotly::ggplotly(., tooltip = "text").}

\item{stat}{Statistical transformation. A character string (e.g. "identity").}

\item{position}{Position adjustment. Either a character string (e.g."identity"), or a function (e.g. ggplot2::position_identity()).}

\item{pal}{Colours to use. A character vector of hex codes (or names).}

\item{pal_na}{Colour to use for NA values. A character vector of a hex code (or name).}

\item{alpha}{Opacity. A number between 0 and 1.}

\item{bins}{Number of bins. An integer 0 upwards.}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed to the relevant ggplot2::geom_* function.}

\item{titles}{A function to format the x, y and col titles, including in rlang lambda format. Defaults to snakecase::to_sentence_case.}

\item{title}{Title string.}

\item{subtitle}{Subtitle string.}

\item{coord}{Coordinate system.}

\item{x_breaks}{A function that takes the limits as input (e.g. scales::breaks_pretty()), or a vector of breaks.}

\item{x_expand}{Padding to the limits with the ggplot2::expansion function, or a vector of length 2 (e.g. c(0, 0)).}

\item{x_include}{For a numeric or date variable, any values that the scale should include (e.g. 0).}

\item{x_labels}{A function that takes the breaks as inputs (e.g. scales::label_comma()), or a vector of labels.}

\item{x_limits}{A vector of length 2 to determine the limits of the axis.}

\item{x_oob}{A scales::oob_* function for how to deal with out-of-bounds values.}

\item{x_title}{Axis title string. Defaults to converting to sentence case with spaces. Use "" for no title.}

\item{x_trans}{For a numeric variable, a transformation object (e.g. "log10").}

\item{y_breaks}{A function that takes the limits as input (e.g. scales::breaks_pretty()), or a vector of breaks.}

\item{y_expand}{Padding to the limits with the ggplot2::expansion function, or a vector of length 2 (e.g. c(0, 0)).}

\item{y_include}{For a numeric or date variable, any values that the scale should include (e.g. 0).}

\item{y_labels}{A function that takes the breaks as inputs (e.g. scales::label_comma()), or a vector of labels.}

\item{col_intervals}{A function to cut or chop the numeric variable into intervals (e.g. ~ santoku::chop_mean_sd(.x, drop = FALSE)).}

\item{col_labels}{A function that takes the breaks as inputs (e.g. scales::label_comma()), or a vector of labels. Note this does not affect where col_intervals is not NULL.}

\item{col_legend_place}{The place for the legend. "b" for bottom, "r" for right, "t" for top, or "l" for left.}

\item{col_legend_ncol}{The number of columns for the legend elements.}

\item{col_legend_nrow}{The number of rows for the legend elements.}

\item{col_limits}{A vector to determine the limits of the axis.}

\item{col_title}{Axis title string. Defaults to converting to sentence case with spaces. Use "" for no title.}
