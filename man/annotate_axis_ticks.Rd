annotate_axis_ticks(
  ...,
  position,
  x = NULL,
  y = NULL,
  colour = NULL,
  linewidth = NULL,
  length = NULL,
  theme_element = "transparent"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Require named arguments (and support trailing commas).}

\item{position}{The position of the axis ticks. One of "top", "bottom", "left", or "right".}

\item{x}{A vector of x-axis breaks for axis ticks. Cannot be used together with y.}

\item{y}{A vector of y-axis breaks for axis ticks. Cannot be used together with x.}

\item{colour}{The colour of the annotated segment. Inherits from the current theme axis.ticks etc.}

\item{linewidth}{The linewidth of the annotated segment. Inherits from the current theme axis.ticks etc.}

\item{length}{The absolute length of the annotated segment as a grid unit. Defaults to theme's axis.ticks.length (typically rel(0.66)).}

\item{theme_element}{What to do with the equivalent theme element. Either "transparent", "keep" or "blank". Defaults "transparent".}
}
\value{
A list of a annotate layer and theme elements.
}
\description{
Replace axis ticks with annotated segments using absolute measurements.
This function only works when panel dimensions are set via panel.widths and panel.heights.
It requires a \code{coord} of \code{ggplot2::coord_cartesian(clip = "off")}.
