\arguments{
\item{position}{The position of the axis ticks. One of "top", "bottom", "left", or "right".}

\item{...}{Require named arguments (and support trailing commas).}

\item{x}{A vector of x-axis breaks for axis ticks. Cannot be used together with y.}

\item{y}{A vector of y-axis breaks for axis ticks. Cannot be used together with x.}

\item{colour}{The colour of the annotated segment. Inherits from the current theme axis.ticks etc.}

\item{linewidth}{The linewidth of the annotated segment. Inherits from the current theme axis.ticks etc.}

\item{length}{The absolute length of the annotated segment as a grid unit. Defaults to theme's axis.ticks.length (typically rel(0.66)).}

\item{theme_element}{What to do with the equivalent theme elements. Either "keep" , "transparent", or "blank". Defaults "keep".}
}
\value{
A list of a annotate layer and theme elements.

\description{
Create annotated segments of the axis ticks.

This function is designed to work with a theme that is globally set with \link{set_blanket} or \link[ggplot2:get_theme]{ggplot2::set_theme}.

It should be used with a \code{coord} of \code{ggplot2::coord_cartesian(clip = "off")}.

It only works when panel dimensions are set are set in the theme.
