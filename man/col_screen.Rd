\title{Screen blend colours}
\usage{
col_screen(col, col2 = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{col}{A character vector of colours or a \verb{scales::pal_*()} function}

\item{col2}{A character vector of colours or a \verb{scales::pal_*()} function, or NULL.
If NULL (default), col is blended with itself.}

\item{...}{Require named arguments (and support trailing commas).}
}
\value{
If inputs are character vectors, returns a character vector of blended colours.
If either input is a function, returns a function that generates blended colours.
}
\description{
Blends two colours using screen mode, creating a lighter, more luminous effect.
Works with both colour vectors and palette functions. If only one colour is provided,
it blends the colour with itself. Screen is the inverse of multiply - it lightens
rather than darkens.
}
\examples{
# Blend two colours
col_screen("#FF0000", "#0000FF")  # Red + Blue = Magenta

# Screen a colour with itself
col_screen("#FF6600")

# Work with vectors
col_screen(c("#FF0000", "#00FF00"), c("#0000FF", "#FF00FF"))

# Work with palette functions
pal <- col_screen(scales::pal_viridis(), scales::pal_brewer(palette = "Set1"))
pal(5)

# Screen a palette function with itself
pal_screened <- col_screen(scales::pal_viridis())
pal_screened(5)
}
