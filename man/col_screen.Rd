\title{Screen blend colours}
\usage{
col_screen(col, col2 = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{col}{A character vector of colours or a \verb{scales::pal_*()} function}

\item{col2}{Optional second colour vector or palette function to blend with.
If NULL (default), col is blended with itself.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently unused, reserved for future extensions)}
}
\value{
If inputs are character vectors, returns a character vector of blended colours.
If either input is a function, returns a function that generates blended colours.
}
\description{
Blends two colours using screen mode, creating a lighter, more luminous effect.
Works with both colour vectors and palette functions. If only one colour is provided,
it blends the colour with itself. Screen is the inverse of multiply - it lightens
rather than darkens.
}
\examples{
# Blend two colours
col_screen("#000080", "#800000")  # Dark blue + Dark red = Lighter purple

# Screen a colour with itself (makes it lighter)
col_screen("#404040")  # Gray screened = Lighter gray

# Work with vectors
col_screen(c("#FF0000", "#00FF00"), c("#0000FF", "#FF00FF"))

# Work with palette functions
pal <- col_screen(scales::pal_viridis(), scales::pal_brewer(palette = "Set1"))
pal(5)

# Screen a palette function with itself
pal_screened <- col_screen(scales::pal_viridis())
pal_screened(5)

# Works with transparency
col_screen("#00008080", "#80000080")  # 50\% dark blue + 50\% dark red
}
