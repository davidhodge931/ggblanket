## Overview

ggblanket is a package of wrapper functions around the fantastic ggplot2 package.

The primary objective is to **simplify visualisation**.

Secondary objectives relate to:

* Scope: cover the most useful 80% of what ggplot2 does
* Design: produce well-designed visualisation by default
* Alignment: use conventions generally aligned with ggplot2. 

It is intended to be useful for all levels of experience from beginner to expert.
