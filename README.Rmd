## Purpose

ggblanket is a package of wrapper functions around the fantastic ggplot2 package.

The primary objective is to **simplify ggplot2 visualisation**.

Secondary objectives relate to:

* Scope: cover the most useful 80% of what ggplot2 does
* Design: produce well-designed visualisation by default
* Alignment: use conventions generally aligned with ggplot2. 

It is intended to be useful for all levels of experience from beginner to expert.

## Installation

``` r
install.packages("ggblanket")
```
## Example

```{r, fig.asp = 0.6}
library(ggblanket)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(dplyr)

penguins |>
  tidyr::drop_na(sex) |> 
  mutate(sex = stringr::str_to_sentence(sex)) |>
  gg_histogram(
    x = flipper_length_mm,
    col = sex,
    facet = species,
    pal = c("#2596be", "#fc7c24"))
```
