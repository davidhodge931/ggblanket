## Overview

ggblanket is a package of ggplot2 wrapper functions.

The primary objective is to **simplify ggplot2 visualisation**.

Secondary objectives relate to:

* Design: produce well-designed visualisation
* Alignment: align with ggplot2 and tidyverse
* Scope: cover much of what ggplot2 does.

Computational speed has been traded-off.

## Installation

``` r
install.packages("ggblanket")
```
## Example

```{r, fig.asp=0.6}
library(ggblanket)
library(palmerpenguins)

set_blanket()

penguins |>
  gg_histogram(
    x = flipper_length_mm,
    col = species,
  )
```
