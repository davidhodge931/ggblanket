## Overview

ggblanket is a package of ggplot2 wrapper functions.

The primary objective is to **simplify ggplot2 visualisation**.

Secondary objectives relate to:

* Design: produce well-designed visualisation
* Alignment: use conventions aligned with ggplot2
* Scope: cover much of what ggplot2 does.

## How it works
 
1.  Almost forty `gg_*` wrapper functions
2.  A `col` argument to colour and fill by a variable
3.  A `facet` argument to facet by a variable
4.  A `facet2` argument to facet by a 2nd variable
5.  A `col_pal` argument to customise colours
6.  Numerous other prefixed arguments to customise 
7.  Unspecified titles converted to `snakecase::sentence_case` 
8.  A `theme` argument for auto grid/line/ticks removal
9.  Provided theme families for legend placement
10. A symmetrical continuous scale with easy opt-out
11. Access to other `geom_*` arguments via `...`
12. Turn-off either coloured outlines or interiors
13. Ability to add multiple `geom_*` layers
14. Other key differences to ggplot2
15. A `gg_blanket()` function with `geom` flexibility

```{r setup}
library(ggblanket)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(tidyr)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(patchwork)
```
 
### 1. Almost forty `gg_*` wrapper functions

Each `gg_*` function wraps a ggplot2 `ggplot2::ggplot()` function with the applicable ggplot2 `geom_*()` function. 

Each `gg_*` function is named after the `geom_*` function they wrap. 

```{r}
penguins |>
  gg_point(
    x = flipper_length_mm,
    y = body_mass_g,
  )
```

### 2. A single `col` argument to colour and fill by a variable

The colour and fill aesthetics of ggplot2 are merged into a single concept represented by the `col` argument. 

This combined aesthetic means that everything should be coloured according to it, i.e. all coloured outlines and filled interiors. 

```{r}
penguins |>
  gg_point(
    x = flipper_length_mm,
    y = body_mass_g, 
    col = species,
  )
```

```{r, fig.asp=0.45}
penguins |>
  drop_na(sex) |>
  mutate(across(sex, \(x) str_to_sentence(x))) |>
  gg_bar(
    y = species, 
    col = sex,
    width = 0.75,
    position = "dodge",
  )
```

### 3. A `facet` argument to facet by a variable

Faceting is treated as if it were an aesthetic. Users just provide an unquoted variable to facet by. 

Whenever a `facet` variable is provided (and a `facet2` variable _not_ provided), the `facet_layout` will default to `"wrap"`. 

```{r}
penguins |>
  drop_na(sex) |> 
  mutate(across(sex, \(x) str_to_sentence(x))) |> 
  gg_histogram(
    x = flipper_length_mm,
    facet = species,
  )
```

### 4. A `facet2` argument to facet by a 2nd variable

A `facet2` argument is also provided for extra functionality and flexibility. 

This enables users to facet easily in a `"grid"` layout of the `facet` variable horizontally by the `facet2` variable vertically. 

Whenever a `facet2` variable is provided, the `facet_layout` will default to `"grid"`. 

```{r, fig.asp=0.75}
penguins |>
  mutate(across(sex, \(x) str_to_sentence(x))) |> 
  gg_histogram(
    x = flipper_length_mm,
    facet = species,
    facet2 = sex,
  )
```

### 5. A `col_pal` argument to customise colours

The `col_pal` argument is used to customise the colours of the geom. A user can provide a vector of colours to this argument. It can be named or not. It works in a consistent way - regardless of whether a `col` aesthetic is added or not. 

```{r}
penguins |>
  gg_jitter(
    x = species, 
    y = body_mass_g, 
    col_pal = "#112E51",
  )
```

```{r}
penguins |> 
  drop_na(sex) |> 
  mutate(across(sex, \(x) str_to_sentence(x))) |> 
  gg_density(
    x = flipper_length_mm,
    col = sex,
    col_pal = c(navy, greys[2]),
  )
```

### 6.  Numerous other prefixed arguments to customise 

ggblanket offers numerous arguments to customise that are prefixed by whether they relate to `x`, `y`, `col`, `facet` or `alpha`. 

These prefixed arguments work nicely with the Rstudio autocomplete, if users ensure their settings support the use of tab for autocompletions and multi-line autocompletions (i.e. Tools - Global Options - Code - Completion).

```{r}
penguins |>
  drop_na(sex) |>  
  gg_jitter(
    x = species,
    y = body_mass_g,
    col = flipper_length_mm,
    facet = sex,
    x_labels = \(x) str_sub(x, 1, 1),
    y_expand_limits = 0,
    y_breaks = scales::breaks_width(1500), 
    y_labels = scales::label_number(big.mark = " "), 
    y_expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.05)),
    y_transform = "sqrt",
    y_title = "Body mass (g)",
    col_continuous_type = "steps",
    facet_labels = \(x) str_to_sentence(x),
  )
```

```{r, echo = FALSE,   fig.width = 3, fig.asp = 2}
knitr::include_graphics("autocomplete_y.png", dpi = 300)
```

### 7.  Unspecified titles converted to `snakecase::sentence_case`

Unspecified `x`, `y`, `col` and `alpha` titles are converted to sentence case with `snakecase::to_sentence`. 

However, each title can be manually changed using the applicable `*_title` argument. Use `*_title = ""` to remove a title. 

The default `snakecase::to_sentence` conversion can be turned off using `titles = \(x) x`. 

```{r, fig.asp=0.6}
diamonds |>
  gg_hex(
    x = carat,
    y = price,
    coord = coord_cartesian(clip = "on"), 
    y_limits = c(0, 20000),
  )
```

### 8.  A `theme` argument for auto gridline, axis-line and axis-ticks removal

ggblanket has a `theme` argument that users can add a `*_mode_*` theme to.

The `gg_*` function will guess whether the plot is `flipped` or not. This `flipped` argument can be specified where it does not guess correctly.

For `flipped = FALSE` graphs, the `gg_*` function will remove generally vertical gridlines, and the y axis-line and axis-ticks. For `flipped = TRUE` graphs, the vice versa will occur. 

If you do not want this auto gridline/axis-line and axis-ticks removal to apply, then you should use instead `+` the theme on to the plot as a layer. 

You can access the `theme` argument globally using `ggplot2::theme_set()`. 

```{r}
d <- data.frame(
  trt = factor(c(1, 1, 2, 2)),
  resp = c(1, 5, 3, 4),
  group = factor(c(1, 2, 1, 2)),
  upper = c(1.1, 5.3, 3.3, 4.2),
  lower = c(0.8, 4.6, 2.4, 3.6)
)

p1 <- d |>
  gg_errorbar(
    x = trt,
    ymin = lower,
    ymax = upper,
    col = group,
    width = 0.1,
    x_title = "Treatment",
    y_title = "Response",
    theme = grey_mode_n(),
  ) 

p2 <- d |>
  gg_errorbar(
    x = trt,
    ymin = lower,
    ymax = upper,
    col = group,
    width = 0.1,
    x_title = "Treatment",
    y_title = "Response",
  ) +
  grey_mode_n()

p3 <- d |>
  gg_errorbar(
    x = trt,
    ymin = lower,
    ymax = upper,
    col = group,
    width = 0.1,
    x_title = "Treatment",
    y_title = "Response",
  ) +
  grey_mode_n() +
  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_blank()) 

p1 + p2 + p3
```

### 9.  Provided theme families for legend placement

ggblanket provides three families of themes: `grey_mode_*`, `light_mode_*`, and `dark_mode_*`. 

Each theme family provides 5 variants that differ based on legend placement, which is represented by the suffix of the theme name of `rt`  (right-top), `r` (right-centre), `b` (bottom), `t` (top) and `n` (none). 

The default is `grey_mode_rt`.

```{r, fig.asp=0.7}
# theme_set(grey_mode_t())

penguins |>
  gg_histogram(
    x = flipper_length_mm,
    col = species,
    title = "Penguin flipper length by species",
    subtitle = "Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica",
    caption = "Source: Gorman, 2020", 
    col_title = "",
    theme = grey_mode_t(),
  ) 
```

```{r, fig.asp=0.75}
# theme_set(light_mode_t())

penguins |>
  gg_histogram(
    x = flipper_length_mm,
    col = species,
    title = "Penguin flipper length by species",
    subtitle = "Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica",
    caption = "Source: Gorman, 2020", 
    theme = light_mode_b(),
  ) 
```

```{r, fig.asp=0.65}
# theme_set(dark_mode_t())

penguins |>
  gg_histogram(
    x = flipper_length_mm,
    col = species,
    title = "Penguin flipper length by species",
    subtitle = "Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica",
    caption = "Source: Gorman, 2020", 
    theme = dark_mode_r(),
  ) 
```

### 10. A symmetrical continuous scale with easy opt-out

For `flipped = FALSE` graphs, the `gg_*` function will create a symmetric continuous y scale by default with: 

* `y_limits` that are the range of the `y_breaks` 
* `y_expand` of `c(0, 0)`

For `flipped = TRUE`, the vice-versa occurs.

Sometimes you may need to add `*_expand_limits = 0`, if the lower bound of the symmetric scale falls on a number close to 0.

This symmetric scale can be turned off easily using `*_limits = c(NA, NA)` (or `*_limits = c(0, NA)` for bars etc).

Note this symmetric scale does not occur where the scale has a transformation that is _not_ `"identity"`, `"reverse"`, `"date"`, `"time"` or `"hms"` - or where the other positional scale is binned.

```{r}
p1 <- d |>
  gg_errorbar(
    x = trt,
    ymin = lower,
    ymax = upper,
    col = group,
    width = 0.1,
    x_title = "Treatment",
    y_title = "Response",
    theme = grey_mode_n(),
  ) 

p2 <- d |>
  gg_errorbar(
    x = trt,
    ymin = lower,
    ymax = upper,
    col = group,
    width = 0.1,
    x_title = "Treatment",
    y_title = "Response",
    y_limits = c(NA, NA),
    theme = grey_mode_n(),
  ) 

p3 <- d |>
  gg_col(
    x = trt,
    y = upper,
    col = group,
    position = "dodge",
    width = 0.5,
    x_title = "Treatment upper",
    y_title = "Response",
    y_limits = c(0, NA),
    theme = grey_mode_n(),
  ) 

p1 + p2 + p3
```

### 11. Access to other `geom_*` arguments via `...`

The `...` argument provides access to all other arguments in the `geom_*()` function. 

```{r}
penguins |>
  mutate(across(sex, \(x) str_to_sentence(x))) |> 
  drop_na(sex) |> 
  gg_smooth(
    x = flipper_length_mm,
    y = body_mass_g,
    col = sex, 
    se = TRUE, # via ... from geom_smooth
    level = 0.999, # via ... from geom_smooth
  ) 
```

### 12. Turn-off either coloured outlines or filled interiors

For geom's that have both coloured outlines and interiors, these are both coloured by default.

you can turn off one of these by `alpha_pal = 0` for the filled interior, or `col_pal = scales::alpha(..., alpha = 0)` for the coloured outlines.

For coloured outlines where a `col` argument is specified, you might need to also  modify the `col_pal_na` value using `col_pal_na = scales::alpha("darkgrey", alpha = 0)`. 

[Note where a `col` argument is specified, another method is to use `fill = NA`/`colour = NA`.]

```{r, fig.asp=0.4}
penguins |>
  gg_boxplot(
    x = flipper_length_mm,
    y = species,
    position = position_dodge2(preserve = "single"),
    alpha_pal = 0, #or col_pal = scales::alpha(blue, 0),
  )
```

```{r}
penguins |>
  gg_boxplot(
    x = species,
    y = flipper_length_mm,
    col = sex,
    position = position_dodge2(preserve = "single"),
    alpha_pal = 0,
  )
```

### 13. Ability to add multiple `geom_*` layers

Users can make plots with multiple layers with ggblanket by adding on `ggplot2::geom_*` layers. 

The `gg_*` function puts the aesthetic variables (i.e. `x`, `y`, `col`) within the wrapped `ggplot` function. Therefore, these aesthetics will inherit to any subsequent layers added - unless a `inherit.aes = FALSE` argument is added. 

The `gg_*()` function _should_ be appropriate to be the bottom layer of the plot, as geoms are drawn in order. 

All of the aesthetics required for the plot as a whole should generally be added into the `gg_*` function, including the `col` argument. If you do not want the first layer to have a colour and fill aesthetic, but you wish later layers to access this - use `gg_blanket()` (as it defaults to a `blank` geom). 

```{r, fig.asp = 0.4}
penguins |>
  group_by(species) |>
  summarise(body_mass_g = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  mutate(lower = body_mass_g * 0.95) |> 
  mutate(upper = body_mass_g * 1.2) %>%
  gg_col(
    x = body_mass_g,
    xmin = lower, 
    xmax = upper,
    y = species,
    col = species,
    width = 0.75,
    x_expand_limits = c(0, max(.$upper)),
    x_labels = \(x) x / 1000, 
    x_title = "Body mass kg", 
  ) +
  geom_errorbar(
    colour = "black", 
    width = 0.1, 
  ) 
```

```{r, fig.asp=0.4}
penguins |>
  group_by(species) |>
  summarise(body_mass_g = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  mutate(lower = body_mass_g * 0.95) |> 
  mutate(upper = body_mass_g * 1.2) |> 
  gg_blanket( 
    x = body_mass_g,
    y = species,
    col = species,
    xmin = lower, 
    xmax = upper,
    width = 0.75,
    x_expand_limits = 0,
    x_labels = \(x) x / 1000, 
    x_title = "Body mass kg",
  ) +
  geom_col(
    colour = "#d3d3d3",#fix to constant
    fill = "#d3d3d3",#fix to constant
    alpha = 0.9,
    width = 0.75,
  ) +
  geom_errorbar(
    width = 0.1, 
  ) 
```

### 14. Other ggplot2 key differences 

##### Unquoted variables only

ggblanket requires unquoted variables only for `x`, `y`, `col`, `facet`, `facet2` and  `alpha`. You cannot wrap these in a function. Instead you may need to manipulate the data prior to plotting, or use the `mapping` argument for other non-supported aesthetics, delayed evaluation etc. 

```{r}
p1 <- diamonds |>
  count(color) |>
  gg_col(
    x = n,
    y = color,
    width = 0.75,
    x_labels = \(x) x / 1000,
    x_title = "Count (thousands)", 
  )

p2 <- diamonds |>
  count(color) |>
  mutate(across(color, \(x) x |>
           forcats::fct_reorder(n) |>
           forcats::fct_rev())) |>
  gg_col(
    x = n,
    y = color,
    width = 0.75,
    x_labels = \(x) x / 1000,
    x_title = "Count (thousands)", 
  )

p1 + p2
```

##### Unused factor levels kept

ggblanket keeps unused factor levels in the plot. If users wish to drop unused levels they should likewise do it in the data prior to plotting using `forcats::fct_drop`. 

```{r, fig.asp=0.4}
p1 <- diamonds |> 
  count(color) |>
  filter(color %in% c("E", "G", "I")) |>
  gg_col(
    x = n,
    y = color,
    width = 0.75,
    x_labels = \(x) x / 1000,
    x_title = "Count (thousands)", 
  )

p2 <- diamonds |> 
  count(color) |>
  filter(color %in% c("E", "G", "I")) |>
  mutate(color = forcats::fct_drop(color)) |> 
  gg_col(
    x = n,
    y = color,
    width = 0.75,
    x_labels = \(x) x / 1000,
    x_title = "Count (thousands)", 
  )

p1 + p2
```

##### Different `oob` & `clip` defaults

By default, ggblanket keeps values outside of the limits (`*_oob = scales::oob_keep`) in calculating the geoms and scales to plot. It also does _not_ clip anything outside the cartesian coordinate space by default (`coord = ggplot2::coord_cartesian(clip = "off"`)). 

ggplot2 by default drops values outside of the limits in calculating the geoms and scales to plot (`scales::oob_censor`), and clips anything outside the cartesian coordinate space (`coord = ggplot2::coord_cartesian(clip = "on"`)).

This needs to be considered particularly when you are using `x_limits` or `y_limits`, and your stat is _not_ `"identity"`.  

##### Alpha

`alpha` is fully supported in ggblanket in a similar way to `col`. So the `alpha` argument represents an aesthetic, whereas `alpha_pal` represents a value (or values or range). 

##### Other

* `*_title` is equivalent to `ggplot2::labs(* = ...)`
* Facet arguments `strip.position` and `switch` are renamed `facet_labels_position` and `facet_labels_switch`
* `y` categorical variables are reversed, so that they are read from low levels (top) to high levels (bottom) 
* Logical variables are reversed, so that `TRUE` always comes before `FALSE`
* Infinite values are treated as `NA`
* `facet_axes` and `facet_axis_labels` have different defaults.

### 15. A `gg_blanket` function with `geom` flexibility

ggblanket is driven by the `gg_blanket` function, which has a `geom` argument with `geom_blank` defaults.

All other functions wrap this function with a locked-in geom, and their own default `stat` and `position` arguments as per the applicable `geom_*` function.

```{r}
penguins |>
  gg_blanket(
    geom = "bar",
    stat = "bin",
    position = "stack",
    x = flipper_length_mm, 
    col = species,
  ) 
```

```{r}
penguins |>
  drop_na(sex) |>
  mutate(across(sex, \(x) str_to_sentence(x))) |>
  gg_blanket(
    geom = "violin",
    stat = "ydensity",
    position = "dodge",
    x = sex,
    y = body_mass_g,
    col = species,
  )
```
