## Overview

ggblanket is a package of ggplot2 wrapper functions.

The primary objective is to **simplify ggplot2 visualisation**.

Secondary objectives relate to:

* Design: produce well-designed visualisation
* Alignment: use conventions aligned with ggplot2
* Scope: cover much of what ggplot2 does.

## How it works
 
1.  Almost forty `gg_*` wrapper functions
2.  A `col` argument to colour and fill by a variable
3.  A `facet` argument to facet by a variable
4.  A `facet2` argument to facet by a 2nd variable
5.  A `col_pal` argument to customise colours
6.  Numerous other prefixed arguments to customise 
7.  Unspecified titles converted to `snakecase::sentence_case`
8.  A `mode` argument designed for provided `*_mode_*` themes
9.  Families of `*_mode_*` themes that differ by legend placement 
10.  A symmetrical continuous scale with easy opt-out
11. Access to other `geom_*` arguments via `...`
12. Turn-off either coloured outlines or interiors
13. Ability to add multiple `geom_*` layers
14. Use `alpha` and other aesthetics
15. A `gg_blanket()` function with `geom` flexibility

```{r setup}
library(ggblanket)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(tidyr)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(patchwork)
```
 
### 1. Almost forty `gg_*` wrapper functions

Each `gg_*` function wraps a ggplot2 `ggplot2::ggplot()` function with the applicable ggplot2 `geom_*()` function. 

Each `gg_*` function is named after the `geom_*` function they wrap. 

```{r}
penguins |>
  gg_point(
    x = flipper_length_mm,
    y = body_mass_g,
  )
```

### 2. A single `col` argument to colour and fill by a variable

The colour and fill aesthetics of ggplot2 are merged into a single concept represented by the `col` argument. 

This combined aesthetic means that everything should be coloured according to it, i.e. all coloured outlines and filled interiors. 

```{r}
penguins |>
  gg_point(
    x = flipper_length_mm,
    y = body_mass_g, 
    col = species,
  )
```

```{r, fig.asp=0.45}
penguins |>
  drop_na(sex) |>
  mutate(across(sex, \(x) str_to_sentence(x))) |>
  gg_bar(
    y = species, 
    col = sex,
    width = 0.75,
    position = "dodge",
  )
```

### 3. A `facet` argument to facet by a variable

Faceting is treated as if it were an aesthetic. Users just provide an unquoted variable to facet by. 

Whenever a `facet` variable is provided (and a `facet2` variable _not_ provided), the `facet_layout` will default to `"wrap"`. 

```{r}
penguins |>
  drop_na(sex) |> 
  mutate(across(sex, \(x) str_to_sentence(x))) |> 
  gg_histogram(
    x = flipper_length_mm,
    facet = species,
  )
```

### 4. A `facet2` argument to facet by a 2nd variable

A `facet2` argument is also provided for extra functionality and flexibility. 

This enables users to facet easily in a `"grid"` layout of the `facet` variable horizontally by the `facet2` variable vertically. 

Whenever a `facet2` variable is provided, the `facet_layout` will default to `"grid"`. 

```{r, fig.asp=0.75}
penguins |>
  mutate(across(sex, \(x) str_to_sentence(x))) |> 
  gg_histogram(
    x = flipper_length_mm,
    facet = species,
    facet2 = sex,
  )
```

### 5. A `col_pal` argument to customise colours

The `col_pal` argument is used to customise the colours of the geom. A user can provide a vector of colours to this argument. It can be named or not. It works in a consistent way - regardless of whether a `col` aesthetic is added or not. 

```{r}
penguins |>
  gg_jitter(
    x = species, 
    y = body_mass_g, 
    col_pal = "#7FCDBB",
  )
```

```{r, fig.asp=0.33}
viridisLite::rocket(n = 9)

sf::st_read(system.file("shape/nc.shp", package = "sf"), quiet = TRUE) |> 
  gg_sf(
    col = AREA,
    col_pal = viridisLite::rocket(n = 9)
  )
```

### 6.  Numerous other prefixed arguments to customise 

ggblanket offers numerous arguments to customise that are prefixed by whether they relate to `x`, `y`, `col`, `facet` or `alpha`. 

These prefixed arguments work nicely with the Rstudio autocomplete, if users ensure their settings support the use of tab for autocompletions and multi-line autocompletions (i.e. Tools - Global Options - Code - Completion).

```{r}
penguins |>
  drop_na(sex) |>  
  gg_jitter(
    x = species,
    y = body_mass_g,
    col = flipper_length_mm,
    facet = sex,
    x_labels = \(x) str_sub(x, 1, 1),
    y_expand_limits = 0,
    y_breaks = scales::breaks_width(1500), 
    y_labels = scales::label_number(big.mark = " "), 
    y_expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.05)),
    y_transform = "sqrt",
    y_title = "Body mass (g)",
    col_continuous_type = "steps",
    facet_labels = \(x) str_to_sentence(x),
  )
```

```{r, echo = FALSE,   fig.width = 3, fig.asp = 2}
knitr::include_graphics("autocomplete_y.png", dpi = 300)
```

### 7.  Unspecified titles converted to `snakecase::sentence_case`

Unspecified `x`, `y`, `col` and `alpha` titles are converted to sentence case with `snakecase::to_sentence`. 

However, each title can be manually changed using the applicable `*_title` argument. 

The default `snakecase::to_sentence` conversion can be turned off using `titles = \(x) x`. 

Note the `*_mode_*` functions have arguments to remove a `x_title`, `y_title` or `legend_title`.

```{r, fig.asp=0.6}
diamonds |>
  gg_hex(
    x = carat,
    y = price,
    coord = coord_cartesian(clip = "on"), 
    y_limits = c(0, 20000),
  )
```

### 8.  A `mode` argument designed for provided `*_mode_*` themes

A `mode` argument has been designed for use with the `*_mode_*` themes. 

When a mode is provided it, the `gg_*` function will:

* guess whether the plot is `flipped` or not
* for `flipped = FALSE` graphs, remove vertical grid-lines, and the y axis-line/ticks 
* for `flipped = TRUE` graphs, remove horizontal grid-lines, and the x axis-line/ticks 

To avoid these side-effects, `+` the theme on to the output of `gg_*`.

`mode_set` sets the theme globally with these side-effects - and `ggplot2::theme_set` sets it globally without these side-effects. 

Use `mode_set(light_mode_r())` or `theme_set(theme_grey())` to unset. Note you cannot actually set the theme globally to `theme_grey(11)` for this reason - instead use `theme_grey(11.01)`.

Note you can specify whether `flipped = TRUE` or `flipped = FALSE`, if it guesses incorrectly.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
d <- data.frame(
  trt = factor(c(1, 1, 2, 2)),
  resp = c(1, 5, 3, 4),
  group = factor(c(1, 2, 1, 2)),
  upper = c(1.1, 5.3, 3.3, 4.2),
  lower = c(0.8, 4.6, 2.4, 3.6)
)

p1 <- d |>
  gg_errorbar(
    x = trt,
    ymin = lower,
    ymax = upper,
    col = group,
    width = 0.1,
    x_title = "Treatment",
    y_title = "Response",
    mode = light_mode_n(),
    subtitle = "\nmode = light_mode_n(),"
  ) 

p2 <- d |>
  gg_errorbar(
    x = trt,
    ymin = lower,
    ymax = upper,
    col = group,
    width = 0.1,
    x_title = "Treatment",
    y_title = "Response",
    subtitle = "\n+ light_mode_n()"
  ) +
  light_mode_n() 

p1 + p2 
```

### 9.  Families of `*_mode_*` themes that differ by legend placement 

Three theme families are provided: `light_mode_*`, `grey_mode_*` and `dark_mode_*`.

Each theme family provides 4 variants that differ based on legend placement, which is represented by the suffix of the mode name of `r` (right), `b` (bottom), `t` (top) and `n` (none). 

The default is `light_mode_r`.

These are intended for use with the `mode` argument.

Note you can `+ theme(legend.position = "right")` on to `*_mode_r` to move the legend to the centre of the right.

```{r, fig.asp=0.7}
penguins |>
  gg_histogram(
    x = flipper_length_mm,
    col = species,
    title = "Penguin flipper length by species",
    subtitle = "Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica",
    caption = "Source: Gorman, 2020", 
    mode = light_mode_t(legend_title = FALSE),
  ) 
```

```{r, fig.asp=0.75}
penguins |>
  gg_histogram(
    x = flipper_length_mm,
    col = species,
    title = "Penguin flipper length by species",
    subtitle = "Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica",
    caption = "Source: Gorman, 2020", 
    mode = grey_mode_b(),
  ) 
```

```{r, fig.asp=0.65}
penguins |>
  gg_histogram(
    x = flipper_length_mm,
    col = species,
    col_pal = c(teal, orange, plum),
    title = "Penguin flipper length by species",
    subtitle = "Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica",
    caption = "Source: Gorman, 2020", 
    mode = dark_mode_r(),
  ) 
```

### 10. A symmetrical continuous scale with easy opt-out

For `flipped = FALSE` graphs, the `gg_*` function will create a symmetric continuous y scale by default with: 

* `y_limits` that are the range of the `y_breaks` 
* `y_expand` of `c(0, 0)`

For `flipped = TRUE`, the vice-versa occurs.

Sometimes you may need to add `*_expand_limits = 0`, if the lower bound of the symmetric scale falls on a number close to 0.

This symmetric scale can be turned off easily using `*_limits = c(NA, NA)` (or `*_limits = c(0, NA)` for bars etc).

Note this symmetric scale does not occur where the scale has a transformation that is _not_ `"identity"`, `"reverse"`, `"date"`, `"time"` or `"hms"` - or where the other positional scale is binned.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
d <- data.frame(
  trt = factor(c(1, 1, 2, 2)),
  resp = c(1, 5, 3, 4),
  group = factor(c(1, 2, 1, 2)),
  upper = c(1.1, 5.3, 3.3, 4.2),
  lower = c(0.8, 4.6, 2.4, 3.6)
)

p1 <- d |>
  gg_errorbar(
    x = trt,
    ymin = lower,
    ymax = upper,
    col = group,
    width = 0.1,
    x_title = "Treatment",
    y_title = "Response",
    mode = light_mode_n(),
    subtitle = "\nDefault y scale"
  ) 

p2 <- d |>
  gg_errorbar(
    x = trt,
    ymin = lower,
    ymax = upper,
    col = group,
    width = 0.1,
    x_title = "Treatment",
    y_title = "Response",
    y_limits = c(NA, NA),
    mode = light_mode_n(),
    subtitle = "\ny_limits = c(NA, NA),"
  ) 

p3 <- d |>
  gg_col(
    x = trt,
    y = upper,
    col = group,
    position = "dodge",
    width = 0.5,
    x_title = "Treatment upper",
    y_title = "Response",
    y_limits = c(0, NA),
    mode = light_mode_n(),
    subtitle = "\ny_limits = c(0, NA),"
  ) 

p1 + p2 + p3
```

### 11. Access to other `geom_*` arguments via `...`

The `...` argument provides access to all other arguments in the `geom_*()` function. 

```{r}
penguins |>
  mutate(across(sex, \(x) str_to_sentence(x))) |> 
  drop_na(sex) |> 
  gg_smooth(
    x = flipper_length_mm,
    y = body_mass_g,
    col = sex, 
    se = TRUE, # via ... from geom_smooth
    level = 0.999, # via ... from geom_smooth
  ) 
```

### 12. Turn-off either coloured outlines or filled interiors

For geom's that have both coloured outlines and interiors, these are both coloured by default.

you can turn off one of these by `alpha_pal = 0` for the filled interior, or `col_pal = scales::alpha(..., alpha = 0)` for the coloured outlines.

For coloured outlines where a `col` argument is specified, you might need to also  modify the `col_pal_na` value using `col_pal_na = scales::alpha("darkgrey", alpha = 0)`. 

[Note where a `col` argument is specified, another method is to use `fill = NA`/`colour = NA`.]

```{r, fig.asp=0.4}
penguins |>
  gg_boxplot(
    x = flipper_length_mm,
    y = species,
    position = position_dodge2(preserve = "single"),
    alpha_pal = 0, #or col_pal = scales::alpha(blue, 0),
  )
```

```{r}
penguins |>
  gg_boxplot(
    x = species,
    y = flipper_length_mm,
    col = sex,
    position = position_dodge2(preserve = "single"),
    alpha_pal = 0,
  )
```

### 13. Ability to add multiple `geom_*` layers

Users can make plots with multiple layers with ggblanket by adding on `ggplot2::geom_*` layers. 

The `gg_*` function puts the aesthetic variables (i.e. `x`, `y`, `col`) within the wrapped `ggplot` function. Therefore, these aesthetics will inherit to any subsequent layers added - unless a `inherit.aes = FALSE` argument is added. 

The `gg_*()` function _should_ be appropriate to be the bottom layer of the plot, as geoms are drawn in order. 

All of the aesthetics required for the plot as a whole should generally be added into the `gg_*` function, including the `col` argument. If you do not want the first layer to have a colour and fill aesthetic, but you wish later layers to access this - use `gg_blanket()` (as it defaults to a `blank` geom). 

```{r, fig.asp = 0.4}
penguins |>
  group_by(species) |>
  summarise(body_mass_g = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  mutate(lower = body_mass_g * 0.95) |> 
  mutate(upper = body_mass_g * 1.2) %>%
  gg_col(
    x = body_mass_g,
    xmin = lower, 
    xmax = upper,
    y = species,
    col = species,
    width = 0.75,
    x_expand_limits = c(0, max(.$upper)),
    x_labels = \(x) x / 1000, 
    x_title = "Body mass kg", 
  ) +
  geom_errorbar(
    colour = "black", 
    width = 0.1, 
  ) 
```

```{r, fig.asp=0.4}
penguins |>
  group_by(species) |>
  summarise(body_mass_g = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  mutate(lower = body_mass_g * 0.95) |> 
  mutate(upper = body_mass_g * 1.2) |> 
  gg_blanket( 
    x = body_mass_g,
    y = species,
    col = species,
    xmin = lower, 
    xmax = upper,
    width = 0.75,
    x_expand_limits = 0,
    x_labels = \(x) x / 1000, 
    x_title = "Body mass kg",
  ) +
  geom_col(
    colour = "#d3d3d3",
    fill = "#d3d3d3",
    alpha = 0.9,
    width = 0.75,
  ) +
  geom_errorbar(
    width = 0.1, 
  ) 
```

### 14. Use `alpha` and other aesthetics

The `alpha` is fully supported in ggblanket in a similar way to `col`. So the `alpha` argument represents an aesthetic, whereas `alpha_pal` represents a value (or values or range). 

The `mapping` argument provides access to the `size`, `shape`, `linetype` and `linewidth` aesthetics within the `gg_*` function. 

Legend titles and element order must be aligned, if legends are to merge. Subsequently, you may need to change a shape or linetype title using `+ ggplot2::labs` to align it with the `col_title`. 

In general, users should use `ggplot2::labs` and `ggplot2::scale_*` to manipulate `size`, `shape`, `linetype` and `linewidth` aesthetics.

```{r}
penguins |> 
  gg_point(
    x = flipper_length_mm, 
    y = body_mass_g, 
    col = species,
    alpha = species,
    alpha_pal = c(1, 1, 0.33),
    mapping = aes(shape = species),
  ) 
```

### 15. A `gg_blanket` function with `geom` flexibility

ggblanket is driven by the `gg_blanket` function, which has a `geom` argument with `geom_blank` defaults.

All other functions wrap this function with a locked-in geom, and their own default `stat` and `position` arguments as per the applicable `geom_*` function.

```{r}
penguins |>
  gg_blanket(
    geom = "bar",
    stat = "bin",
    position = "stack",
    x = flipper_length_mm, 
    col = species,
  ) 
```

```{r}
penguins |>
  drop_na(sex) |>
  mutate(across(sex, \(x) str_to_sentence(x))) |>
  gg_blanket(
    geom = "violin",
    stat = "ydensity",
    position = "dodge",
    x = sex,
    y = body_mass_g,
    col = species,
  )
```
