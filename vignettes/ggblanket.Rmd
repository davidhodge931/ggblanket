## Overview

ggblanket is a package of wrapper functions around the fantastic ggplot2 package.

The primary objective is to **simplify ggplot2 visualisation**.

Secondary objectives relate to:

* Scope: cover the most useful 80% of what ggplot2 does
* Design: produce well-designed visualisation by default
* Alignment: use conventions generally aligned with ggplot2. 

It is intended to be useful for all levels of experience from beginner to expert.

```{r setup}
library(ggblanket)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(ggiraph)
library(patchwork)
```

## How it works

To simplify ggplot2 visualisation, the ggblanket package provides:

1. `gg_*` wrapper functions to plot a single geom
2.  A single `col` argument to colour and fill by a variable
3.  A `facet` argument to facet by a variable
4.  An additional `facet2` argument to facet by a second variable
5.  A `pal` argument to customise colours
6.  Prefixed arguments to customise scales, guides, titles and faceting 
7.  Default titles converted with `snakecase::to_sentence`
8.  Pretty default numeric limits
9.  Horizontal plots with y labels in order etc
10. A `pal` that generally inherits to subsequent geoms
11. Access to other `geom_*` arguments via `...`
12. A `theme` argument to customise the look and feel
13. A `gg_theme` function to create a quick theme 
14. A base from which to create custom plot functions with your own defaults
15. Works with the `patchwork` package
16. Works with the `ggiraph` package
17. Over 30 different geoms wrapped into a `gg_*` function 

### 1. `gg_*` wrapper functions to plot a single geom

These `gg_*`functions each wrap a ggplot2 `ggplot(aes(...))` function with the applicable ggplot2 `geom_*()` function.

All aesthetics (other than `text`) are within the `ggplot` function, and therefore will inherit to any subsequent geom's added by default.

Always pipe in your data, so that you can access variable names from the Rstudio autocomplete.

```{r}
iris |>
  mutate(Species = str_to_sentence(Species)) |> 
  gg_point(
    x = Sepal.Width, 
    y = Sepal.Length, 
    col = Species)
```

### 2.A single `col` argument to colour and fill by a variable

{ggblanket} merges the col and fill aesthetics of ggplot2 into one concept represented by the `col` argument. In ggplot2 language, this argument always represents both col and fill.

```{r}
penguins |> 
  gg_histogram(
    x = body_mass_g, 
    col = species) 
```

### 3. A `facet` argument to facet by a variable

faceting is treated essentially as if it were an aesthetic, where users just provide an unquoted variable to facet by. 

If a single facet (or facet2) variable is provided, it'll default to a "wrap" layout. But you can change this with a `facet_layout = "grid"` argument.

```{r}
penguins |> 
  tidyr::drop_na(sex) |>
  mutate(sex = str_to_sentence(sex)) |>
  gg_violin(
    x = sex, 
    y = body_mass_g, 
    facet = species)
```

### 4. An additional `facet2` argument to facet by a second variable

A `facet2` argument is also provided for extra functionality and flexibility.

If both `facet`and `facet2` variables are provided, then it'll default to a "grid" layout of `facet` by `facet2`. But you can change this with a `facet_layout = "wrap"` argument. 

```{r, fig.asp=0.75}
penguins |>
  tidyr::drop_na(sex) |>
  mutate(sex = str_to_sentence(sex)) |> 
  gg_density(
    x = flipper_length_mm,
    col = sex,
    facet = species,
    facet2 = island
  )
```

### 5.  A `pal` argument to customise colours

The `pal` argument allows the users to pick the vector of colours they want.

These arguments work in the same way regardless of whether a `col` variable is specified or not. 

```{r}
penguins |> 
  mutate(sex = str_to_sentence(sex)) |> 
  group_by(species, sex) |> 
  summarise(body_mass_g = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)) |> 
  gg_col(
    x = species, 
    y = body_mass_g, 
    col = sex, 
    position = position_dodge2(preserve = "single"),
    pal = c("#1B9E77", "#9E361B"))
```

### 6.  Prefixed arguments to customise scales, guides, titles and faceting 

These prefixed arguments are designed to work with the Rstudio autocomplete to help you remember and find the adjustment you need. 

Determine whether what you want to change relates to `x`,`y`, `col` or `facet`, and then type this prefix and press the tab key to access the list from autocomplete. Then use arrow keys, and press tab again to select.

Available arguments are:

* `*_breaks`: Adjust the breaks of a scale
* `*_expand`: Adjust the padding beyond the limits on a scale
* `*_include`: Include a value within a scale 
* `*_labels`: Adjust the labels on the breaks of a scale
* `*_limits`: Adjust the limits on a scale
* `*_trans`: Transform a scale (e.g. "log10", "sqrt" or "reverse") 
* `*_title`: Add a title
* `*_sec_axis`: Add a secondary x or y axis
* `*_grid`: Add or remove a x or y gridline
* `col_continuous` How to colour a continuous variable (e.g. "steps")
* `col_rescale`: Rescale a continuous col variable non-linearly
* `col_legend_place`: Place to put the legend (e.g. "r")
* `col_legend_ncol`: Number of columns to arrange legend elements into
* `col_legend_nrow`: Number of rows to arrange legend elements into
* `col_legend_rev`: Whether to reverse the legend 
* `facet_layout`: Whether the layout is to be "wrap" or "grid"
* `facet_scales`: How facet scales are to be treated
* `facet_space`: Whether facet space is to be allocated proportionally
* `facet_ncol`: How many columns to wrap facets into  
* `facet_nrow`: How many rows to wrap facets into
* `clip`: Whether to clip to the panel ("on") or not ("off")

```{r}
penguins |>
  gg_jitter(
    x = species,
    y = body_mass_g,
    col = flipper_length_mm,
    col_continuous = "steps",
    y_include = 0,
    y_trans = "sqrt",
    y_breaks = scales::breaks_width(1500), 
    y_labels = scales::label_number()
  )
```

### 7. Default titles converted with `snakecase::to_sentence`

This will make quicker to get to a plot that has titles that are good for external people to see, and will often work nicely for your `snakecase` column names. 

For titles that you need to change manually, you can change manually using `x_title`, `y_title`, or `col_title`. 

To remove titles, you can use `x_title = ""` within the `gg_*` function and equivalent for the y and col titles. 

```{r}
penguins |>
  group_by(species, sex) |>
  summarise(
    flipper_length_mm = round(mean(flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE), 0)) |>
  gg_tile(
    x = sex, 
    y = species, 
    col = flipper_length_mm, 
    width = 0.9,
    height = 0.9,
    pal = rev(pals::brewer.rdbu(9)), 
    col_legend_place = "r",
    col_rescale = c(186, 215, 222),
    x_labels = snakecase::to_sentence_case,
    title = "Average penguin body mass",
    subtitle = "Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica",
    theme = gg_theme(plot_background_pal = "white",
                     axis_line_pal = "white", 
                     axis_ticks_pal = "white")) +
  geom_text(aes(label = flipper_length_mm), col = "#232323", size = 3.5) 
```

### 8. Pretty default numeric limits

The default x and y scales have been designed to create symmetry.

If the `y` is numeric, the y limits will default to the max of the `y` breaks with zero `y` expanding. It will do similar with the `x` scale, if `y` is character/factor/logical and `x` is numeric. 

To revert to the min/max of the data, use `*_limits = c(NA, NA)` or `*_limits = c(lubridate::NA_Date_, lubridate::NA_Date_)`.

```{r}
storms |>
  group_by(year) |>
  filter(between(year, 1980, 2020)) |>
  summarise(wind = mean(wind, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  gg_line(
    x = year,
    y = wind,
    x_labels = scales::label_number(big.mark = ""),
    y_include = 0,
    title = "Storm wind speed",
    subtitle = "USA average storm wind speed, 1980\u20132020",
    y_title = "Wind speed (knots)",
    caption = "Source: NOAA"
  ) +
  geom_point()
```

### 9. Horizontal plots with y labels in order etc

When plots are horizontal, ggblanket ensures y labels are in order.

The position of bars, `pal` colours and legend elements will mostly be in the right order too.

```{r}
penguins |>
  tidyr::drop_na(sex) |> 
  group_by(species, sex, island) |>
  summarise(body_mass_kg = mean(body_mass_g) / 1000) |>
  gg_col(
    x = body_mass_kg, 
    y = species, 
    col = sex, 
    facet = island,
    width = 0.75,
    col_labels = snakecase::to_sentence_case, 
    position = "dodge")
```

### 10. A `pal` that inherits to subsequent geoms

The `pal` is generally inherited to subsequent geom layers regardless of whether there is a `col` argument.

It does this because 'under the hood', dummy `col` and `fill` aesmthetic variables are added, and a colour scale is then added with the legend turned off. 

This approach can cause some challenges. These are discussed further in the 'Multiple geom layers' section. 

Note `alpha` does not inherit.

```{r}
penguins |>
  gg_boxplot(x = species,
             y = body_mass_g,
             width = 0.5,
             pal = "#1B9E77", 
             outlier.colour = NA) +
  geom_jitter()
```

### 11. Access to other `geom_*` arguments via `...`

This relates to all other arguments other than the mapping argument with aesthetics.

Common arguments to add are `size`, `linewidth` and `width`. All arguments and can be identified through the help on the relevant `ggplot2::geom_*` function.

```{r}
penguins |>
  tidyr::drop_na(sex) |>
  gg_smooth(
    x = flipper_length_mm,
    y = body_mass_g,
    col = sex,
    size = 0.5, 
    level = 0.99, 
    col_legend_place = "t",
    col_title = "", 
    col_labels = snakecase::to_sentence_case
  ) 
```

### 12. A `theme` argument to customise the look and feel

This allows you to utilise the simplicity of ggblanket, while making content that has your required look and feel.

By using the `theme` argument, your theme will control all theme aspects, but with some magic relating to the legend and gridline removal within the `gg_* function`. 

This is why: 

* the `col_legend_place` argument will work regardless of the theme provided to the `theme` argument and
* a theme with gridlines in both directions can be provided so that you get generally appropriate gridlines automatically (e.g. vertical gridlines for horizontal bar plots).  
However... if you do not want any magic and want your theme to adjust _everything_, then just add your theme as a layer instead (e.g. `+ theme_grey()`). 

```{r}
penguins |>
  mutate(sex = str_to_sentence(sex)) |> 
  gg_point(x = bill_depth_mm,
           y = bill_length_mm,
           col = sex,
           facet = species, 
           pal = c("#1B9E77", "#9E361B"), 
           theme = theme_grey())
```

### 13. A `gg_theme` function to create a quick theme 

The `gg_theme` function allows you to modify the default theme by changing text size, colours, margins, among other. 

It includes arguments for adjusting text, background colours, axis lines, ticks and gridlines.

There is also a `void = TRUE` argument that is useful for maps.

```{r}
storms |>
  group_by(year) |>
  filter(between(year, 1980, 2020)) |>
  summarise(wind = mean(wind, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  gg_col(
    x = year,
    y = wind,
    x_labels = scales::label_comma(big.mark = ""),
    x_expand = c(0, 0),
    width = 0.75,
    theme = gg_theme(
      text_size = 11,
      plot_background_pal = "white",
      panel_background_pal = "white"))
```

### 14. A base from which to create custom plot functions with your own defaults

You can easily create powerful custom functions. This is because the `...` argument can allow you to access _all_  arguments within the ggblanket `gg_*` function (and applicable `ggplot2::geom_*` function). 

```{r}
gg_point_custom <- function(data, x, y, col, 
                            size = 3, 
                            shape = 17,
                            pal = pals::brewer.dark2(9), 
                            col_title = "", 
                            col_legend_place = "t",
                            ...) {
  data |> 
    gg_point(x = {{ x }}, y = {{ y }}, col = {{col}}, 
             size = size, 
             shape = shape,
             pal = pal, 
             col_title = col_title, 
             col_legend_place = col_legend_place, 
             ...)
}

iris |>
  mutate(Species = str_to_sentence(Species)) |> 
  gg_point_custom(
    x = Sepal.Width,
    y = Sepal.Length,
    col = Species, 
    title = "Edgar Anderson's iris data",
    subtitle = "Iris sepal length by width and species",
    caption = "Edgar Anderson, 1935"
  )
```

### 15. Works with the `patchwork` package

As `ggblanket` output objects are ggplot's, it works fine with the patchwork,

```{r}
p1 <- diamonds %>% 
  gg_point(
    x = carat,
    y = price
  )

p2 <- diamonds %>% 
  gg_bin2d(
    x = carat,
    y = price,
    caption = "Source: Diamonds Association",
    theme = gg_theme(caption_hjust = 1)
  )

p1 + p2
```

### 16. Works with the `ggiraph` package

By using the powerful `gg_blank` function, you can then use then access the interactivity of `ggiraph`.

When using `gg_blank`, be sure to change the stat to that which will be in your subsequent layer, so that the scales are built appropriately.

`ggblanket` also provides a `add_tooltip` function to create a column of variable names and values, which can then be used for the tooltip. Note this approach only works where the `stat = identity`.

```{r, eval = F}
df <- iris |>
  tibble::tibble() |>
  add_tooltip(Sepal.Width, Sepal.Length, Species)

df |> 
  head(1)

p <- iris |>
  add_tooltip(tidyselect::contains("Sepal"), Species) |>
  mutate(id = row_number()) |>
  gg_blank(x = Sepal.Width,
           y = Sepal.Length,
           col = Species,
           facet = Species, 
           theme = gg_theme("helvetica"),
           facet_labels = snakecase::to_sentence_case) +
  geom_point_interactive(aes(tooltip = tooltip, data_id = id))

girafe(
  ggobj = p,
  width_svg = 5,
  height_svg = 3.25,
  options = list(
    opts_tooltip(use_fill = TRUE, use_stroke = TRUE),
    opts_hover(css = "fill: #d62728; stroke: #d62728"))
)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../man/figures/ggiraph_screenshot.png", dpi = 300)
```

### 17. Over 30 different geoms wrapped into a `gg_*` function

This is the majority of the geoms in ggplot2. See the [reference](https://davidhodge931.github.io/ggblanket/reference/index.html) for the full list of functions available. 

```{r}
nc <- sf::st_read(system.file("shape/nc.shp", package = "sf"), quiet = TRUE)

nc %>% 
  gg_sf(col = AREA)
```

## Challenges

### Multiple geom layers 

For _all_ plots with multiple geom's, you will need to think about if there is any desired drawing order you want, and if so choose the `gg_*` function that permits this order.

For plots where some geoms have a` col` aesthetic and some do not, you must choose a `gg_*` function that relates to one of the layers with a `col` argument. Or, if this conflicts with the desired drawing order, then choose `gg_blank` with the `col` argument. 

Once you know what `gg_*` function you are going to use, then you might need to use the  `*_include` argument to adjust the x or y scale if it will not include all of the range needed by subsequent layers. 

If subsequent layers do _not_ require all of the aesthetics from the `gg_*` function, use the `inherit.aes = FALSE` argument in the `geom_*` function.

For example, to make a coloured column graph with grey error bars, use the `gg_col` function as this layer has a col aesthetic and the drawing order means it should be underneath the errorbars. 

```{r}
df <- data.frame(
  trt = factor(c(1, 1, 2, 2)),
  resp = c(1, 5, 3, 4),
  group = factor(c(1, 2, 1, 2)),
  upper = c(1.1, 5.3, 3.3, 4.2),
  lower = c(0.8, 4.6, 2.4, 3.6)
)

df |> 
  gg_col(
    x = trt,
    y = resp,
    col = group,
    position = "dodge",
    y_include = max(df$upper) 
  ) +
  geom_errorbar(
    aes(x = trt, ymin = lower, ymax = upper, group = group),
    inherit.aes = FALSE,
    col = "#7F7F7F",
    position = position_dodge(width = 0.9),
    width = 0.1
    )
```

### Turning off _part_ of the col aesthetic

In ggblanket, the `col` aesthetic refers to both the ggplot2 colour and fill aesthetics. If you wish to turn off one of these, you can via the ... and `colour = NA` or `fill = NA`.

```{r}
penguins %>%
  gg_blank(
    x = flipper_length_mm,
    y = bill_length_mm,
    col = species,
    col_legend_place = "r"
  ) +
  ggdensity::geom_hdr(colour = NA) +
  labs(alpha = "Probs") +
  guides(alpha = guide_legend(title.position = "top"))
```

### Other aesthetics 

`gg_*` functions do not directly support aesthetics of `alpha`, `size`, `linewidth`, `shape`, and `linetype`. However, you can use `gg_blank`, if you wish to in a slightly hacky way. Note this is easier and works better for graphs with a col aesthetic. 

```{r}
p1 <- penguins |>
  gg_blank(
    x = flipper_length_mm, 
    y = body_mass_g, 
    col = species, 
    col_legend_ncol = 2) +
  geom_point(aes(alpha = species)) +
  labs(alpha = "Species") +
  scale_alpha_manual(values = c(0.1, 1, 0.5))

p2 <- penguins |>
  gg_blank(
    x = flipper_length_mm,
    y = body_mass_g,
    group = species,
    pal = "black",
    col_legend_place = "b", 
    col_legend_ncol = 2
  ) +
  geom_point(aes(alpha = species)) +
  labs(alpha = "Species") +
  scale_alpha_manual(values = c(0.1, 1, 0.5)) +
  guides(alpha = guide_legend(title.position = "top"))

p1 + p2
```
