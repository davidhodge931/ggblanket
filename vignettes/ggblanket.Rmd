## Overview

ggblanket is a package of ggplot2 wrapper functions.

The primary objective is to **simplify ggplot2 visualisation**.

Secondary objectives relate to:

* Design: produce well-designed visualisation
* Alignment: use conventions aligned with ggplot2
* Scope: cover much of what ggplot2 does.

## How it works
 
1.  Almost forty `gg_*` wrapper functions
2.  A `col` argument to colour and fill by a variable
3.  A `facet` argument to facet by a variable
4.  A `facet2` argument to facet by a 2nd variable
5.  A `col_pal` argument to customise colours
6.  Numerous other prefixed arguments to customise 
7.  Unspecified titles converted to `snakecase::sentence_case`
8.  A `mode` argument designed for provided `*_mode_*` themes
9.  Families of `*_mode_*` themes that differ by legend placement 
10.  A symmetrical continuous scale with easy opt-out
11. Access to other `geom_*` arguments via `...`
12. Change colours of either coloured outlines or interiors
13. Ability to add multiple `geom_*` layers
14. Use `alpha` and other aesthetics
15. A `gg_blanket()` function with `geom` flexibility

```{r setup}
library(ggblanket)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(tidyr)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(patchwork)
```
 
### 1. Almost forty `gg_*` wrapper functions

Each `gg_*` function wraps a ggplot2 `ggplot2::ggplot()` function with the applicable ggplot2 `geom_*()` function. 

Each `gg_*` function is named after the `geom_*` function they wrap. 

```{r}
penguins |>
  gg_point(
    x = flipper_length_mm,
    y = body_mass_g,
  )
```

### 2. A single `col` argument to colour and fill by a variable

The colour and fill aesthetics of ggplot2 are merged into a single concept represented by the `col` argument. 

This combined aesthetic means that everything should be coloured according to it, i.e. all coloured outlines and filled interiors. 

```{r}
penguins |>
  gg_point(
    x = flipper_length_mm,
    y = body_mass_g, 
    col = species,
  )
```

```{r, fig.asp=0.45}
penguins |>
  drop_na(sex) |>
  mutate(across(sex, str_to_sentence)) |>
  gg_bar(
    position = "dodge",
    y = species, 
    col = sex,
    width = 0.75,
  )
```

### 3. A `facet` argument to facet by a variable

Faceting is treated as if it were an aesthetic. Users just provide an unquoted variable to facet by. 

Whenever a `facet` variable is provided (and a `facet2` variable _not_ provided), the `facet_layout` will default to `"wrap"`. 

```{r}
penguins |>
  drop_na(sex) |> 
  mutate(across(sex, str_to_sentence)) |> 
  gg_histogram(
    x = flipper_length_mm,
    facet = species,
  )
```

### 4. A `facet2` argument to facet by a 2nd variable

A `facet2` argument is also provided for extra functionality and flexibility. 

This enables users to facet easily in a `"grid"` layout of the `facet` variable horizontally by the `facet2` variable vertically. 

Whenever a `facet2` variable is provided, the `facet_layout` will default to `"grid"`. 

```{r, fig.asp=0.75}
penguins |>
  mutate(across(sex, str_to_sentence)) |> 
  gg_histogram(
    x = flipper_length_mm,
    facet = species,
    facet2 = sex,
  )
```

### 5. A `col_pal` argument to customise colours

The `col_pal` argument is used to customise the colours of the geom. A user can provide a vector of colours to this argument. It can be named or not. It works in a consistent way - regardless of whether a `col` aesthetic is added or not. 

```{r}
penguins |>
  gg_jitter(
    x = species, 
    y = body_mass_g, 
    col_pal = "#7FCDBB",
  )
```

```{r, fig.asp=0.33}
viridisLite::rocket(n = 9)

sf::st_read(system.file("shape/nc.shp", package = "sf"), quiet = TRUE) |> 
  gg_sf(
    col = AREA,
    col_pal = viridisLite::rocket(n = 9)
  )
```

### 6.  Numerous other prefixed arguments to customise 

ggblanket offers numerous arguments to customise that are prefixed by whether they relate to `x`, `y`, `col`, `facet` or `alpha`. 

These prefixed arguments work nicely with the Rstudio autocomplete, if users ensure their settings support the use of tab for autocompletions and multi-line autocompletions (i.e. Tools - Global Options - Code - Completion).

```{r}
penguins |>
  drop_na(sex) |>  
  gg_jitter(
    x = species,
    y = body_mass_g,
    col = flipper_length_mm,
    facet = sex,
    x_labels = \(x) str_sub(x, 1, 1),
    y_breaks = scales::breaks_width(1000),
    y_expand_limits = 2000,
    y_labels = scales::label_number(big.mark = " "), 
    y_transform = "log10",
    y_title = "Body mass (g)",
    col_steps = TRUE,
    col_breaks = \(x) quantile(x, seq(0, 1, 0.25)),
    facet_labels = str_to_sentence,
  )
```

```{r, echo = FALSE,   fig.width = 3, fig.asp = 2}
knitr::include_graphics("autocomplete_y.png", dpi = 300)
```

### 7.  Unspecified titles converted to `snakecase::sentence_case`

Unspecified `x`, `y`, `col` and `alpha` titles are converted to sentence case with `snakecase::to_sentence`. 

However, each title can be manually changed using the applicable `*_title` argument. 

The default `snakecase::to_sentence` conversion can be turned off using `titles_to_case = \(x) x` or changed (e.g. `snakecase::to_title_case`). 

```{r, fig.asp=0.6}
diamonds |>
  gg_hex(
    coord = coord_cartesian(clip = "on"), 
    x = carat,
    y = price,
    y_limits = c(0, 20000),
  )
```

### 8.  A `mode` argument designed for provided `*_mode_*` themes

A `mode` argument has been designed for use with the `*_mode_*` themes. 

When a mode is provided it, the `gg_*` function will:

* guess whether the orientation of the plot
* for vertical graphs, remove x grid-lines, and the x axis-line/ticks 
* for horizontal graphs, remove y grid-lines, and the y axis-line/ticks 

To avoid these side-effects, `+` the theme on to the output of `gg_*`.

`mode_set` sets the theme globally with these side-effects - and `ggplot2::theme_set` sets it globally without these side-effects. 

Use `mode_set(light_mode_r())` or `theme_set(theme_grey())` to unset. Note you cannot actually set the theme globally to `theme_grey(11)` for this reason - instead use `theme_grey(11.01)`.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
d <- data.frame(
  trt = factor(c(1, 1, 2, 2)),
  resp = c(1, 5, 3, 4),
  group = factor(c(1, 2, 1, 2)),
  upper = c(1.1, 5.3, 3.3, 4.2),
  lower = c(0.8, 4.6, 2.4, 3.6)
)

p1 <- d |>
  gg_errorbar(
    x = trt,
    ymin = lower,
    ymax = upper,
    col = group,
    width = 0.1,
    x_title = "Treatment",
    y_title = "Response",
    subtitle = "\nmode = light_mode_n(),",
    mode = light_mode_n(),
  ) 

p2 <- d |>
  gg_errorbar(
    x = trt,
    ymin = lower,
    ymax = upper,
    col = group,
    width = 0.1,
    x_title = "Treatment",
    y_title = "Response",
    subtitle = "\n+ light_mode_n()"
  ) +
  light_mode_n() 

p1 + p2 
```

### 9.  Families of `*_mode_*` themes that differ by legend placement 

Three theme families are provided: `light_mode_*`, `grey_mode_*` and `dark_mode_*`.

Each theme family provides 4 variants that differ based on legend placement, which is represented by the suffix of the mode name of `r` (right), `b` (bottom), `t` (top) and `n` (none). 

The default is `light_mode_r`.

These are intended for use with the `mode` argument.

If you want to use a quick non-bold title, use `subtitle = "\n..."`.

A title can be removed using `+ labs(... = NULL)`. For removing the the legend associated with `col`, you should add both `colour = NULL` and `fill = NULL`. An alternative approach is to add `+ theme(legend.title = element_blank())` to the plot.

```{r, fig.asp=0.7}
penguins |>
  gg_histogram(
    x = flipper_length_mm,
    col = species,
    title = "Penguin flipper length by species",
    subtitle = "Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica",
    caption = "Source: Gorman, 2020", 
    mode = light_mode_t(),
  ) +
  labs(colour = NULL, fill = NULL)
```

```{r, fig.asp=0.75}
penguins |>
  gg_histogram(
    x = flipper_length_mm,
    col = species,
    title = "Penguin flipper length by species",
    subtitle = "Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica",
    caption = "Source: Gorman, 2020", 
    mode = grey_mode_b(),
  ) 
```

```{r, fig.asp=0.65}
penguins |>
  gg_histogram(
    x = flipper_length_mm,
    col = species,
    col_pal = c(teal, orange, plum),
    title = "Penguin flipper length by species",
    subtitle = "Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica",
    caption = "Source: Gorman, 2020", 
    mode = dark_mode_r(),
  ) 
```

### 10. A symmetrical continuous scale with easy opt-out

For `flipped = FALSE` graphs, the `gg_*` function will create a symmetric continuous y scale by default with: 

* `y_limits` that are the range of the `y_breaks` 
* `y_expand` of `c(0, 0)`

For `flipped = TRUE`, the vice-versa occurs.

Sometimes you may need to add `*_expand_limits = 0`, if the lower bound of the symmetric scale falls on a number close to 0.

This symmetric scale can be turned off easily using `*_limits = c(NA, NA)` (or `*_limits = c(0, NA)` for bars etc).

Note this symmetric scale does not occur where the scale has a transformation that is _not_ `"identity"`, `"reverse"`, `"date"`, `"time"` or `"hms"` - or where the other positional scale is binned.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
d <- data.frame(
  trt = factor(c(1, 1, 2, 2)),
  resp = c(1, 5, 3, 4),
  group = factor(c(1, 2, 1, 2)),
  upper = c(1.1, 5.3, 3.3, 4.2),
  lower = c(0.8, 4.6, 2.4, 3.6)
)

p1 <- d |>
  gg_errorbar(
    x = trt,
    ymin = lower,
    ymax = upper,
    col = group,
    width = 0.1,
    x_title = "Treatment",
    y_title = "Response",
    subtitle = "\nDefault y scale",
    mode = light_mode_n(),
  ) 

p2 <- d |>
  gg_errorbar(
    x = trt,
    ymin = lower,
    ymax = upper,
    col = group,
    width = 0.1,
    x_title = "Treatment",
    y_title = "Response",
    y_limits = c(NA, NA),
    subtitle = "\ny_limits = c(NA, NA),",
    mode = light_mode_n(),
  ) 

p3 <- d |>
  gg_col(
    position = "dodge",
    x = trt,
    y = upper,
    col = group,
    width = 0.5,
    x_title = "Treatment upper",
    y_title = "Response",
    y_limits = c(0, NA),
    subtitle = "\ny_limits = c(0, NA),",
    mode = light_mode_n(),
  ) 

p1 + p2 + p3
```

### 11. Access to other `geom_*` arguments via `...`

The `...` argument provides access to all other arguments in the `geom_*()` function. 

```{r}
penguins |>
  mutate(across(sex, str_to_sentence)) |> 
  drop_na(sex) |> 
  gg_smooth(
    x = flipper_length_mm,
    y = body_mass_g,
    col = sex, 
    se = TRUE, # via ... from geom_smooth
    level = 0.999, # via ... from geom_smooth
  ) 
```

### 12. Change colours of either coloured outlines or interiors

For geom's that have both coloured outlines and interiors, these are both coloured by default.

You can turn either of these off using `colour = NA` or `fill = NA` or turn

```{r, fig.asp=0.4}
penguins |>
  gg_boxplot(
    position = position_dodge2(preserve = "single"),
    x = flipper_length_mm,
    y = species,
    colour = "#121B24", 
  )
```

```{r}
penguins |>
  gg_density(
    x = flipper_length_mm,
    fill = NA,
    mode = light_mode_n(),
  )
```

### 13. Ability to add multiple `geom_*` layers

Users can make plots with multiple layers with ggblanket by adding on `ggplot2::geom_*` layers. 

The `gg_*` function puts the aesthetic variables (i.e. `x`, `y`, `col`) within the wrapped `ggplot` function. Therefore, these aesthetics will inherit to any subsequent layers added - unless a `inherit.aes = FALSE` argument is added. 

The `gg_*()` function _should_ be appropriate to be the bottom layer of the plot, as geoms are drawn in order. 

All of the aesthetics required for the plot as a whole should generally be added into the `gg_*` function, including the `col` argument. If you do not want the first layer to have a colour and fill aesthetic, but you wish later layers to access this - use `gg_blanket()` (as it defaults to a `blank` geom). 

```{r, fig.asp = 0.4}
penguins |>
  group_by(species) |>
  summarise(body_mass_g = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  mutate(lower = body_mass_g * 0.95) |> 
  mutate(upper = body_mass_g * 1.2) %>%
  gg_col(
    x = body_mass_g,
    xmin = lower, 
    xmax = upper,
    y = species,
    col = species,
    width = 0.75,
    x_expand_limits = c(0, max(.$upper)),
    x_labels = \(x) x / 1000, 
    x_title = "Body mass kg", 
  ) +
  geom_errorbar(
    colour = "black", 
    width = 0.1, 
  ) 
```

```{r, fig.asp=0.4}
penguins |>
  group_by(species) |>
  summarise(body_mass_g = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  mutate(lower = body_mass_g * 0.95) |> 
  mutate(upper = body_mass_g * 1.2) |> 
  gg_blanket( 
    x = body_mass_g,
    y = species,
    col = species,
    xmin = lower, 
    xmax = upper,
    width = 0.75,
    x_expand_limits = 0,
    x_labels = \(x) x / 1000, 
    x_title = "Body mass kg",
  ) +
  geom_col(
    colour = "#d3d3d3",
    fill = "#d3d3d3",
    alpha = 0.9,
    width = 0.75,
  ) +
  geom_errorbar(
    width = 0.1, 
  ) 
```

### 14. Use other aesthetics

The `mapping` argument provides access to other aesthetics, such as `alpha`, `size`, `shape`, `linetype` and `linewidth` etc. 

Legend titles and element order must be aligned, if legends are to merge. Subsequently, you may need to change a title using `+ ggplot2::labs` - or even reverse a guide. 

```{r}
penguins |> 
  gg_jitter(
    y = species, 
    x = flipper_length_mm, 
    col = species,
    mapping = aes(alpha = species, shape = species),
  ) +
  scale_alpha_manual(values = c(0.33, 1, 0.33)) +
  guides(alpha = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE))
```

### 15. A `gg_blanket` function with `geom` flexibility

ggblanket is driven by the `gg_blanket` function, which has a `geom` argument with `geom_blank` defaults.

All other functions wrap this function with a locked-in geom, and their own default `stat` and `position` arguments as per the applicable `geom_*` function.

```{r}
penguins |>
  gg_blanket(
    geom = "bar",
    stat = "bin",
    position = "stack",
    x = flipper_length_mm, 
    col = species,
  ) 
```

```{r}
penguins |>
  drop_na(sex) |>
  mutate(across(sex, str_to_sentence)) |>
  gg_blanket(
    geom = "violin",
    stat = "ydensity",
    position = "dodge",
    x = sex,
    y = body_mass_g,
    col = species,
  )
```
