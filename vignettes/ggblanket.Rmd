## Overview

ggblanket is a package of wrapper functions around the fantastic ggplot2 package.

The primary objective is to **simplify visualisation**.

Secondary objectives relate to:

* Scope: cover the most useful 80% of what ggplot2 does
* Design: produce well-designed visualisation by default
* Alignment: use conventions generally aligned with ggplot2. 

It is intended to be useful for all levels of experience from beginner to expert.

```{r setup}
library(ggblanket)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

## How it works

To simplify visualisation, the ggblanket package provides:

* `gg_*` functions to plot a single geom
*  col and fill aesthetics merged into a single `col` argument
*  Colours customised via a `pal` argument consistently
*  A `facet` argument to facet in a "wrap" or "grid" layout
*  An additional `facet2` argument to support facetting by two variables
*  Ability to customise via arguments with consistent prefix's 
*  Unspecified titles converted to `snakecase::to_sentence`
*  Horizontal labels, colours and legends generally arranged in correct order
*  Nice default scales and theme
*  Access to other `geom_*` arguments via `...`
*  A `theme` argument for customisation
*  A `gg_theme` function to create a quick theme 
*  A way to easily create your own customised plot functions
*  Control over `plotly::ggplotly` tooltips with `add_tooltip_text`

### 1. `gg_*` functions to plot a single geom

These `gg_*`functions each wrap a ggplot2 `ggplot(aes(...))` function with the applicable ggplot2 `geom_*()` function.

Always pipe in your data, so that you can access variable names from the Rstudio autocomplete.

```{r}
iris |>
  mutate(Species = str_to_sentence(Species)) |> 
  gg_point(
    x = Sepal.Width, 
    y = Sepal.Length, 
    col = Species)
```

### 2. col and fill aesthetics merged into a single `col` argument

There is no `fill` concept in ggblanket. Instead, `col` relates to both the `col` and `fill` concepts of ggplot2. A message is provided to users in the console to remind them of this. 

```{r}
penguins |> 
  gg_histogram(
    x = body_mass_g, 
    col = species) 
```

### 3. Colours customised via a `pal` argument consistently

These arguments work in the same way regardless of whether a `col` variable is specified or not. This is therefore one less thing for users to remember. The `alpha` argument is also available.

```{r}
penguins |> 
  mutate(sex = str_to_sentence(sex)) |> 
  group_by(species, sex) |> 
  summarise(body_mass_g = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)) |> 
  gg_col(
    x = species, 
    y = body_mass_g, 
    col = sex, 
    position = position_dodge2(preserve = "single"),
    pal = c("#1B9E77", "#9E361B"))
```

### 4. A `facet` argument to facet in a "wrap" or "grid" layout

Facetting is treated as if it is an aesthetic, where the users just provide an unquoted variable to facet by. 

If a single facet (or facet2) variable is provided, it'll default to a "wrap" layout. But you can change this with a `facet_layout = "grid"` argument.

Both layouts have `facet_scales` and `facet_labels` arguments available. The "wrap" layout also has `facet_ncol` and `facet_nrow` arguments available, while the "grid" layout also has the `facet_space`, 

```{r}
penguins |> 
  tidyr::drop_na(sex) |>
  mutate(sex = str_to_sentence(sex)) |> 
  gg_violin(
    x = sex, 
    y = body_mass_g, 
    facet = species, 
    y_include = 0, 
    y_breaks = scales::breaks_width(1000),
    pal = "#1B9E77")
```

### 5. An additional `facet2` argument to support facetting by two variables

Faceting by two variables is often useful. If both `facet`and `facet2` variables are provided, then the gg_* function will default to a "grid" layout of `facet` by `facet2`. But you can change this with a `facet_layout = "wrap"` argument. 

```{r, fig.asp=0.75}
penguins |>
  tidyr::drop_na(sex) |>
  mutate(sex = str_to_sentence(sex)) |> 
  gg_density(
    x = flipper_length_mm,
    col = sex,
    facet = species,
    facet2 = island
  )
```

### 6. Ability to customise via arguments with consistent prefix's

There is lots of customisation available through carefully named arguments with consistent prefixes.

This is designed to work with the Rstudio autocomplete to help you find the adjustment you need. Press the tab key after typing `x`,`y`, `col` or `facet` to access the list from autocomplete. Then use arrow keys, and press tab again to select.

Available arguments are:

* `*_breaks`: Adjust the breaks of an axis
* `*_expand`: Adjust the padding beyond the limits
* `*_include`: Include a value within a scale 
* `*_labels`: Adjust the labels on the breaks
* `*_limits`: Adjust the limits 
* `*_trans`: Transform an axis 
* `*_sec_axis`: Add a secondary axis
* `*_title`: Add a title
* `col_continuous` How to colour a continuous variable (e.g. "steps")
* `col_legend_place`: Place to put the legend (e.g. "r")
* `col_legend_ncol`: Number of columns to arrange legend elements into
* `col_legend_nrow`: Number of rows to arrange legend elements into
* `col_legend_rev`: Whether to reverse the legend 
* `facet_layout`: Whether the layout is to be "wrap" or "grid"
* `facet_scales`: How facet scales are to be treated
* `facet_space`: Whether facet space is to be allocated proportionally
* `facet_ncol`: How many columns to wrap facets into  
* `facet_nrow`: How many rows to wrap facets into

Note that ggblanket keeps out-of-bound values (i.e. it uses scales::oob_keep under the hood). However, you can zoom in using `coord = coord_cartesian(xlim = ..., ylim = ...)` (or by filtering the data).

```{r}
penguins |>
  gg_jitter(
    x = species,
    y = body_mass_g,
    col = flipper_length_mm,
    col_continuous = "steps",
    y_include = 0,
    y_breaks = scales::breaks_width(1500), 
    y_labels = scales::label_number()
  )
```

### 7. Unspecified titles converted to `snakecase::to_sentence`

This will make quicker to get to a plot that has titles that are good for external people to see, and will often work nicely for your `snakecase` column names. 

For titles that you need to change manually, you can change manually using `x_title`, `y_title`, or `col_title`. 

To remove titles, you can use `x_title = ""` within the `gg_*` function and equivalent for the y and col titles. Or add a `+ ggplot2::labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, col = NULL, fill = NULL)` layer as applicable.

```{r}
penguins |>
  group_by(species, sex) |>
  summarise(across(body_mass_g, ~ round(mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE)), 0)) |> 
  gg_tile(
    x = sex, 
    y = species, 
    col = body_mass_g, 
    x_labels = snakecase::to_sentence_case,
    pal = pals::brewer.blues(9), 
    width = 0.9,
    height = 0.9,
    col_legend_place = "r",
    title = "Average penguin body mass",
    subtitle = "Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica",
    theme = gg_theme(grid_h = FALSE,
                     bg_plot_pal = "white",
                     axis_pal = "white", 
                     ticks_pal = "white")) +
  geom_text(aes(label = body_mass_g), col = "#232323", size = 3.5) 
```

### 8. Horizontal labels, colours and legends generally arranged in correct order

When plots are horizontal, ggblanket ensures y labels, colours and legends are generally in the right order. 

```{r}
penguins |>
  tidyr::drop_na(sex) |> 
  group_by(species, sex, island) |>
  summarise(body_mass_kg = mean(body_mass_g) / 1000) |>
  gg_col(
    x = body_mass_kg, 
    y = species, 
    col = sex, 
    facet = island,
    width = 0.75,
    col_labels = snakecase::to_sentence_case, 
    position = "dodge")
```

### 9. Nice default scales and theme

The default x and y scales have been designed to create symmetry and balance.

If the y is numeric, the y limits will default to the max of the y breaks with zero y expanding. It will do similar with the x scale, if y is character/factor/logical and x is numeric. 

The default theme has a clean look designed to draw attention to the patterns of the data in the panel.

Note if you use default theme, ggblanket guesses the gridlines you want based on the type of data provided to the `gg_*` function. If you provide a theme, you will need that theme to provide any gridlines that you want. 

```{r}
storms |>
  group_by(year) |>
  filter(between(year, 1980, 2020)) |>
  summarise(wind = mean(wind, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  gg_line(
    x = year,
    y = wind,
    x_labels = scales::label_number(big.mark = ""),
    y_include = 0,
    title = "Storm wind speed",
    subtitle = "USA average storm wind speed, 1980\u20132020",
    y_title = "Wind speed (knots)",
    caption = "Source: NOAA"
  ) +
  geom_point()
```

### 10. Access to other `geom_*` arguments via `...`

This relates to all other arguments other than the mapping argument with aesthetics.

Common arguments to add are `size`, `linewidth` and `width`. All arguments and can be identified through the help on the relevant `ggplot2::geom_*` function.

```{r}
penguins |>
  tidyr::drop_na(sex) |>
  gg_smooth(
    x = flipper_length_mm,
    y = body_mass_g,
    col = sex,
    size = 0.5, 
    level = 0.99, 
    col_legend_place = "t",
    col_title = "", 
    col_labels = snakecase::to_sentence_case
  ) 
```

### 11. A `theme` argument for customisation

This allows you to utilise the simplicity of ggblanket, while making content that has your required look and feel.

By using the `theme` argument, your theme will control all theme aspects, _other_ than the legend position, direction and justification. 

These are controlled within the `gg_*` function, so that legend positions can be adjusted easily with the `col_legend_place` argument (e.g. ``col_legend_place = "r"`).

If you prefer to have your `theme` adjust everything _including_ the legend, then add your theme as a layer instead (e.g. `+ theme_grey()`). 

```{r}
penguins |>
  mutate(sex = str_to_sentence(sex)) |> 
  gg_point(x = bill_depth_mm,
           y = bill_length_mm,
           col = sex,
           facet = species, 
           pal = c("#1B9E77", "#9E361B"), 
           theme = theme_grey())
```

### 12. A `gg_theme` function to create a quick theme 

The `gg_theme` function allows you to create a theme that looks similar to the ggblanket look and feel. 

This includes the following arguments for adjusting  gridlines, background colours, text and axis lines and ticks. 

Use the `grid_h` and `grid_v` logical arguments to add gridlines. Otherwise this function defaults to no gridlines.

There is a `void = TRUE` argument that is useful for maps.

```{r}
storms |>
  group_by(year) |>
  filter(between(year, 1980, 2020)) |>
  summarise(wind = mean(wind, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  gg_col(
    x = year,
    y = wind,
    x_labels = scales::label_comma(big.mark = ""),
    x_expand = c(0, 0),
    width = 0.75,
    theme = gg_theme(
      bg_plot_pal = "white",
      bg_panel_pal = "white",
      grid_h = TRUE))
```

### 13. A way to easily create your own customised plot functions

This is because the `...` argument can allow you to access _all_  arguments within the ggblanket `gg_` function. 

```{r}
gg_point_custom <- function(data, x, y, col, 
                            size = 3, 
                            pal = pals::brewer.dark2(9), 
                            col_title = "", 
                            col_legend_place = "t",
                            ...) {
  data |> 
    gg_point(x = {{ x }}, y = {{ y }}, col = {{col}}, 
             size = size, 
             pal = pal, 
             col_title = col_title, 
             col_legend_place = col_legend_place, 
             ...)
}

iris |>
  mutate(Species = str_to_sentence(Species)) |> 
  gg_point_custom(
    x = Sepal.Width,
    y = Sepal.Length,
    col = Species, 
    title = "Edgar Anderson's iris data",
    subtitle = "Iris sepal length by width and species",
    caption = "Edgar Anderson, 1935"
  )
```

### 14. Control over `plotly::ggplotly` tooltips with `add_tooltip_text`

The `add_tooltip_text` function allows users to create nice tooltips in combination with the `gg_*()` `text` argument, and the `tooltip = "text"` argument in `ggplotly`.

```{r, eval = F}
theme_custom <- gg_theme(
  "helvetica",
  bg_plot_pal = "white",
  bg_panel_pal = "white",
  grid_h = TRUE
)

iris |> 
  mutate(Species = str_to_sentence(Species)) |> 
  add_tooltip_text(titles = snakecase::to_sentence_case) |> 
  gg_point(
    x = Sepal.Width, 
    y = Sepal.Length, 
    col = Species, 
    text = text, 
    col_legend_place = "r",
    theme = theme_custom) |> 
  plotly::ggplotly(tooltip = "text")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../man/figures/ggplotly_screenshot.png", dpi = 300)
```

## Getting around limitations

Like everything, ggblanket has it's limitations. 

You cannot easily plot:
  
* aesthetics of alpha, size, linewidth, and linetype
* x or y computed variables other than the default (e.g. `density` in `geom_histogram`)
* any geom that has a col or fill computed variable (e.g. `geom_bin2d`)

For aesthetics of `alpha`, `size`, `linewidth`, and `linetype`, you can use `gg_blank` in addition to a `col` argument and then add the title of your new aesthetic to align with the col_title.

```{r}
penguins |> 
  gg_blank(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, col = species) +
  geom_point(aes(shape = species)) +
  labs(shape = "Species")
```

For using non-default _computed_ `x` and `y` variables, you will need to use `ggplot2`. 

You can mimic the ggblanket look and feel if you would like using `gg_theme` and other `scale_*` modifications.

```{r}
diamonds |> 
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = carat, y = after_stat(density)), 
                 col = pal_viridis_mix(1), 
                 fill = pal_viridis_mix(1), 
                 alpha = 0.9) +
  gg_theme(grid_h = TRUE) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.05)), 
                     breaks = scales::breaks_pretty(5)) +
  labs(x = "Carat", y = "Density")
```

Likewise, all geom's that use a _computed_ `col` variable are not supported by ggblanket, and you will need to just use ggplot2. 

```{r}
diamonds |> 
  ggplot() +
  geom_bin_2d(aes(x = carat, y = price, fill = after_stat(count))) +
  gg_theme(grid_h = TRUE) +
  scale_fill_gradientn(colours = viridis::viridis(9)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), 
                     breaks = scales::breaks_pretty(5), 
                     limits = range(scales::breaks_pretty(5)(diamonds$price))) +
  labs(x = "Carat", y = "Price", fill = "Count")
```

For some ggplot2 functionality unsupported by ggblanket, you will be able to add a ggplot2 layer to your ggblanket code. For example, using `+ labs(x = NULL)` or `+ facet_grid(..., switch = "y")`.
